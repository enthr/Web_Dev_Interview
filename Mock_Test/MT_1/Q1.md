# Explain all the CSS positions(static, fixed, sticky, relative, absolute) with one code example each.


## A box may be laid out according to five positioning schemes:


- Normal flow or Static positioning includes block formatting of block-level boxes, inline formatting of inline-level boxes, and relative or sticky positioning of block-level and inline-level boxes.
- For Floats, In the float model, a box is first laid out according to the normal flow, then taken out of the flow and shifted to the left or right as far as possible. Content may flow along the side of a float.
- For Absolute positioning, In the absolute positioning model, a box is removed from the normal flow entirely (it has no impact on later siblings) and assigned a position with respect to a containing block.
- For Fixed Positioning, The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created for the element in the page layout. It is positioned relative to the initial containing block established by the viewport.
- For Sticky positioning, The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document, and then offset relative to its nearest scrolling ancestor and containing block (nearest block-level ancestor), including table-related elements.
- An element is called out of flow if it is floated, absolutely positioned, or is the root element. An element is called in-flow if it is not out-of-flow.

- An element is said to be positioned if its 'position' property has a value other than 'static'. Positioned elements generate positioned boxes, laid out according to four properties: top, right, bottom, left.
